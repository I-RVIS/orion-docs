Quickstart
==========

This guide walks you through a minimal Orion workflow so you can
get up and running in just a few minutes.

---

Basic Import
------------

After installation, verify that Orion is available:

.. code-block:: python

   import orion
   print(orion.__version__)

---

Minimal Example
---------------

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to initialize a solver
and run a basic motion computation.

.. code-block:: python

   from orion.motion import IKSolver
   import numpy as np

   # Create solver
   solver = IKSolver()

   # Example target pose (position + orientation)
   target_position = np.array([0.4, 0.2, 0.3])
   target_orientation = np.eye(3)

   # Solve inverse kinematics
   solution = solver.solve(target_position, target_orientation)

   print("Joint solution:", solution)

---

Working With Models
-------------------

If your workflow involves loading a robot model:

.. code-block:: python

   ARM_MODEL_PATH = "path/to/your/robot.xml"

   solver = IKSolver(model_path=ARM_MODEL_PATH)

Make sure the model file exists and is correctly formatted.

---

Running With a Viewer (Optional)
---------------------------------

If Orion is configured with visualization support:

.. code-block:: python

   trajectory = solver.solveIK_viewer(
       target_position,
       target_orientation
   )

This opens an interactive viewer and displays the motion result.

---

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have a basic setup running, you may want to:

- Explore the :ref:`API Reference <modules>`
- Check available motion utilities
- Read developer notes
- Experiment with different kinematic targets

For more advanced workflows, see the Examples section.
